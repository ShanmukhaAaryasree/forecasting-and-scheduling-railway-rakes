# Forecasting and Scheduling Railway Rakes

## Project Overview
This project is a full-stack web application designed for intelligent forecasting and scheduling of railway rakes. It leverages advanced machine learning models and ant colony optimization techniques to enhance scheduling accuracy during weather changes, festivals, and public events while minimizing empty rake movements. The system dynamically adapts to train delays and changing demand patterns to optimize resource utilization in real-time.

Inspired by the "Where is My Train" app, this platform offers both backend and frontend components, providing real-time train tracking, demand forecasting, and automated rake scheduling for railway operators and passengers.

## Features
- **Demand Forecasting:** Predicts rake requirements using historical and live data.
- **Adaptive Scheduling:** Adjusts schedules in response to weather events, festivals, and public holidays.
- **Ant Colony Optimization:** Efficient rake allocation based on demand patterns.
- **Dynamic Delay Management:** Real-time schedule recalibration to handle train delays.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Interactive dashboards for both users and administrators.
- **Resource Optimization:** Minimizes empty rake movement to reduce operational costs.
  
## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React / Angular / Vue (choose the framework you used)
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
- **Optimization Algorithm:** Ant Colony Optimization (custom implementation)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ShanmukhaAaryasree/railway-rake-forecasting-scheduling_aarya.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd railway-rake-forecasting-scheduling_aarya
   ```
3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # for Python backend
   ```
4. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```
5. Set up environment variables and configure API keys for external data sources (weather, event calendars, train APIs).
6. Run database migrations:
   ```
   # Example for Django
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
7. Start the backend server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver  # or your backend start command
   ```
8. Start the frontend server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- Use admin dashboard to configure schedules, view forecasts, and manage rakes.
- End users can track train locations, schedules, and receive updates on changes.
