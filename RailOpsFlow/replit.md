# Railway Rake Management System

## Overview
Advanced railway rake management system with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for intelligent scheduling, demand forecasting, and minimizing empty rake movements. Built with React, TypeScript, Express, and in-memory storage.

## Purpose
This application helps railway operators:
- Optimize rake (train car) allocation using ACO algorithms
- Minimize empty rake movements to reduce operational costs
- Dynamically adapt schedules based on delays and real-time conditions
- Forecast demand considering festivals, public events, and weather impacts
- Improve scheduling accuracy during adverse weather conditions

## Current State
**Version:** MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
**Last Updated:** October 2025

### Completed Features
- âœ… Complete data schema for rakes, trains, routes, schedules, delays, events, weather, and ACO optimizations
- âœ… Professional railway operations UI with dark mode support
- âœ… Dashboard with real-time metrics and status cards
- âœ… ACO Optimizer interface with visual algorithm representation
- âœ… Dynamic scheduling system with event integration
- âœ… Analytics dashboard with performance charts
- âœ… Status color coding system (success, warning, critical, empty/loaded rakes, weather alerts)
- âœ… Responsive sidebar navigation
- âœ… Theme toggle (light/dark mode)

- Active trains display with status indicators
- Recent delays with impact levels
- Weather conditions panel
- Empty rakes tracker

### 2. ACO Optimizer
- Visual ant colony algorithm representation
- Adjustable parameters (pheromone strength, evaporation rate, iterations)
- Real-time optimization progress
- Historical optimization runs with performance metrics
- Empty movement reduction tracking

### 3. Dynamic Scheduling
- Train schedules with status tracking
- ACO optimization indicators
- Upcoming events calendar (festivals, public events)
- Event impact levels and demand multipliers
- Schedule conflict detection

### 4. Analytics

- Performance metrics and KPIs
- Interactive charts (line, bar)

## Data Models

### Core Entities
1. **Rakes:** Railway cars with capacity, status, location, and load state
2. **Trains:** Train services with routes, schedules, and delay information
3. **Routes:** Railway routes with stations, distance, and duration
4. **Schedules:** Train schedules with rake assignments and optimization flags
5. **Delays:** Delay tracking with reasons, impact levels, and resolution status
6. **Events:** Public events and festivals affecting demand
7. **Weather Conditions:** Weather data with scheduling impact analysis
8. **ACO Optimizations:** Algorithm run history with performance metrics
9. **Demand Forecasts:** Predicted vs actual demand with accuracy tracking

## API Endpoints (To Be Implemented)
- `GET /api/rakes` - Get all rakes
- `GET /api/trains` - Get all trains
- `GET /api/schedules` - Get train schedules
- `GET /api/delays/active` - Get active delays
- `GET /api/weather` - Get weather conditions
- `GET /api/events` - Get events
- `GET /api/stats` - Get dashboard statistics
- `POST /api/aco/run` - Run ACO optimization
- `GET /api/aco/history` - Get optimization history
- `GET /api/analytics` - Get analytics data

## Development Guidelines
- Follow design_guidelines.md for all UI implementations
- Use status colors from index.css for consistent theming
- Maintain professional, operations-focused design
- Ensure all interactive elements have data-testid attributes
- Use font-mono for train IDs, rake numbers, and timestamps
- Keep components modular and reusable

## Next Steps
